# Beers and Breweries

## Abstract
We are pleased to present the results of our analysis of the data you provided. Our objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between alcohol by volume (ABV) and various other factors, such as the number of breweries in each state, the bitterness of beer, and the correlation between bitterness and alcohol content.

In conducting our analysis, we utilized various statistical tools and techniques, including scatter plots, bar charts, and KNN classifiers. Our findings have uncovered several interesting insights that we believe will be of great value to Budweiser.

Please find below a summary of our key findings. If you have any questions or comments, we would be happy to discuss them further. Our aim is to provide you with results that are clear, concise, and actionable.

## Conclusion
From our investigations, we raised a number of considerable questions we were able to answer. We found that just five states accounted for 31% of all breweries, with Colorado alone accounting for an impressive 8%. We found there was a significant portion of the available beer data which had not listed International Bitterness Units (IBU), opening the field to furhter investigation and analysis. We found both the median and mean Alcohol-by-Volume (ABV) metrics for American beers to rest around 5.6%. And the data indicated there was a strongly predictive factor (~79% accuracy) between IBU, ABV, and whether or not a beer would be considered an Indian Pale Ale (IPA). 

Outside of the initial topics proposed for investigation, we went out of our way to gather relevant Driving Under the Influence (DUI) statistics on a state basis. We compared these additional findings with the data from the beers and breweries provided, and we found the data to indicate that there was not a strong correlation between states that produce high-ABV beers and number of DUI incidents. Although this may be confounded by the fact that the beers produced in these states tend to ship both domestically and abroad, we determined this should have an overall positive impact on the marketing and sales division for these more high-caliber products.
